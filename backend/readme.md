```

## API Endpoints

### User Routes (`/user`)

- **POST /user/register**: Registers a new user.

  - **Example Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "fullname": {
        "firstname": "John",
        "lastname": "Doe"
      },
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword"
    }
    ```

  - **Validation:** Uses `express-validator` to validate the email, firstname, and password. See user.routes.js for validation rules.

- **POST /user/login**: Logs in an existing user.

  - **Example Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword"
    }
    ```

  - **Validation:** Uses `express-validator` to validate the email and password. See user.routes.js for validation rules.

- **GET /user/profile**: Retrieves the profile of the logged-in user. Requires authentication.

  - **Authentication:** Uses the `authMiddleware` to verify the JWT token. See auth.middleware.js.

- **GET /user/logout**: Logs out the user by blacklisting the JWT token.

### Captain Routes (`/captain`)

- **POST /captain/register**: Registers a new captain.

  - **Example Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "fullname": {
        "firstname": "Captain",
        "lastname": "Awesome"
      },
      "email": "captain@example.com",
      "password": "captainPassword",
      "vehicle": {
        "color": "red",
        "plate": "ABC-123",
        "capacity": 4,
        "vehicleType": "car"
      }
    }
    ```

- **POST /captain/login**: Logs in an existing captain.

  - **Example Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "email": "captain@example.com",
      "password": "captainPassword"
    }
    ```

  - **Validation:** Uses `express-validator` to validate the email and password.

- **GET /captain/profile**: Retrieves the profile of the logged-in captain. Requires authentication.

  - **Authentication:** Uses the `authMiddleware` to verify the JWT token.

- **GET /captain/logout**: Logs out the captain by blacklisting the JWT token and clearing the cookie.

## Middleware

### Authentication Middleware (`auth.middleware.js`)

- Protects routes by verifying the JWT token sent in the request headers or cookies.
- Checks if the token is blacklisted (logged out).
- Adds the user/captain object to the request (`req.user` or `req.captain`) if the token is valid.

## Models

- **User Model (`user.model.js`)**: Defines the schema for user data, including fullname (firstname, lastname), email, password, and socketId.
- **Captain Model (`captain.model.js`)**: Defines the schema for captain data, including personal information and vehicle details.
- **Blacklist Token Model (`blacklistToken.js`)**: Stores blacklisted JWT tokens to prevent their reuse after logout.

## Services

- **User Services (`user.services.js`)**: Contains business logic for user-related operations, such as creating a new user.
- **Captain Services (`captain.services.js`)**: Contains business logic for captain-related operations, such as creating a new captain.

## Controllers

- **User Controller (`user.controller.js`)**: Handles incoming requests related to users, such as registration, login, and profile management.
- **Captain Controller (`captain.controller.js`)**: Handles incoming requests related to captains, such as registration.

## Database Connection (`db.js`)

- Establishes a connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Uses the `MONGO_URL` environment variable to determine the connection string.

## Main Application (`app.js`)

- Sets up the Express application.
- Configures middleware such as CORS, JSON parsing, and cookie parsing.
- Defines the routes for users and captains.

## Server (`server.js`)

- Creates an HTTP server using Node.js's `http` module.
- Listens for incoming requests on the port specified in the `PORT` environment variable (default: 3000).
